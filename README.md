# Polyfills

This package relies on the following modern JavaScript features. You may need
to include polyfills in your project to support all browsers, or older
versions of Node.

- Node's [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) class ([web polyfill](https://github.com/feross/buffer) available)
- [String.prototype.replaceAll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll)
